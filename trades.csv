We're buying now to position for potential rapid appreciation. Holding USD is capital sitting idle; we're leveraging your balance for maximum exposure and future gains."

As an aggressive, high-risk, high-reward advisor, I recommend selling your BTC now to capitalize on this strength and lock in maximum current value. This positions us to aggressively buy back at a lower price if a pullback occurs, leveraging market volatility for amplified future gains. The risk of missing further upside is outweighed by the potential to significantly increase your BTC holdings on a dip."
